Who am I?

I love to learn things. I studied how the mind experiences and acquires information in my Cognitive Science studies at [UCSD](UCSD.edu) and even tried to model with Natural Computation and Machine Learning.

I love to do things. I've sailed the California Coast, hopped across islands in French Polynesia, raced in Hawaii with my UCSD sailing teammates and won rum series regatta with some friends in New Zealand.

I've also enjoyed these beautiful locations beneath the sea, scuba diving in all these locations - aside from the rather cold waters in New Zealand (though I would certainly take up the opportunity to drysuit it up and see what going on under those kiwi waves).
