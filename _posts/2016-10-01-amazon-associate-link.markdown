Amazon is awesome. We already spend a ton of money there. Help me pay for this site by clicking this link each time before you begin an amazon shopping spree.  

<div class="alignleft">
     <script type="text/javascript">
       	amzn_assoc_ad_type = "banner";
	amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";
	amzn_assoc_region = "US";
	amzn_assoc_placement = "assoc_banner_placement_default";
	amzn_assoc_banner_type = "ez";
	amzn_assoc_p = "7";
	amzn_assoc_width = "468";
	amzn_assoc_height = "40";
	amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "wwwjeradacost-20";
	amzn_assoc_linkid = "2866d68ea633a4d0c1068d8d83bbdb1b";
     </script>

Disclaimer: I directly profit 2% up to 6% (though hardly since that's for the stuff nobody wants to buy anyways).
Fortunately it does not cost me that much to run this site aside from a lot of waisted time and thoughts that someday I'll put together something worth visiting.

I really appreciate it!
