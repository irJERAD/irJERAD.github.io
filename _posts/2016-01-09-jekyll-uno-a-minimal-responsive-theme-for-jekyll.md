I decied to convert my site over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [host it with Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). This allows all my content to live in static files and be built automatically by [GitHub](https://github.com). My hope is that with this simplification (and automation) I might actually post a little more this year.  

During the conversion process I decided that I liked the theme I was currently using with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) but found it was not available for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) yet.  So I decided to port the theme over and share.

Even if this doesn't motivate me to post more at least a new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme came out of it. Enjoy!
