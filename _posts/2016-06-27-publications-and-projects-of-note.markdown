Over the summer of 2012 I conducted research at the amazing CaliT2 at UCSD. It was during this time I created a tactile interface for interacting with digital objects through touch and sensation of texture. [An article](http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/rss.php?id=2016) was published showing the early days of this Scholar program as well as a brief description of my work to come: Immersive Visualization: Combining Touch, Vision, and Sound.
