#### TO DO:
*Create a static page for information like Research, Publications, Awards, CV, Resume, and any information for this site that merits more than the ephemeral disposition imposed upon the content by a blog centered content scheme.*

## MySpace
Aw, the days of [MySpace](https://MySpace.com)...  
I'm sure some would say those days have not passed, and that MySpace is still a viable social platform - ...on second thought, probably not.  
In any case, I am not ashamed that I had one - because we all did! In fact, I revel in the fact that there is a time capsule of my wrenching teenage soul; or is it a tombstone?
Whatever it is, here is my space: [The MySpace of Jerad Acosta](https://myspace.com/121952609) circa 2001 to 2005. What fun to have captured and perhaps held over my head. Now if only I could remember what Blink-182 song's lyrics were my password ;-P

## Google Sites
I created [this Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/jeradacosta/) page in 2011 to catalog the research I was conducting at UCSD. This was a very exciting time as I had quickly gone from volunteering for lab experiments to running my own experiments and was even given significant free reign over the work I would do as I earned access to greater resources.

## Portfolium
Not quite sure what Portfolium did for me. It looks like a place to try and seem smarter or more important and perhaps appear more diligent than I actually am; aw, must be a job finding site!
Well, [Here is my Portfolium Site](https://portfolium.com/jerad)
