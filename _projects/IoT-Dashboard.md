# IoT Dashboard  

Created using the [Losant](https://Losant.com) IoT Platform. Display and reactivity hosted with [Aperture](https://www.losant.com/iot-platform/aperture-iot-data-visualization) and adjusted through [Kiln](https://www.losant.com/iot-platform/kiln-iot-custom-experiences) with the logic and workflow engine [Alloy](https://www.losant.com/iot-platform/alloy-iot-visual-workflow-engine).

## Tutorial  

> If you are particularly interested in seeing the final results of either tutorial or dashboard, reach out to me in the comments or elsewhere to influence my prioritization of projects!

While fiddling around and learning the system, I jotted down notes to create a [tutorial](/IoT-Dashboard-Losant.html) in OmniOutliner.

**NOTE:** Still very much a work in progress - _both the dashboard and the tutorial_ - I will continue to update and progress both items as long as this note is still here.
